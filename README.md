# eYRC 2023-24: "Vanguard" - The GeoGuide Robot

## Project Overview

In the eYRC 2023-24 theme, "Vanguard," an advanced robotic vehicle, navigates a war-torn arena guided by a static drone called "Watchtower." Equipped with machine learning algorithms, Watchtower detects events in real-time, enabling Vanguard to avoid danger zones and adapt to unpredictable alien attacks. Through georeferencing techniques, Vanguard understands its position and coordinates with the command center to strategize against the invaders.

## Key Features

- Autonomous navigation using an overhead camera for guidance
- Simulation of real-world events and accidents for avoidance
- Construction of the "Vanguard" robot with an ESP32 microcontroller
- Utilization of image processing and machine learning techniques
- Implementation of shortest path algorithms
- Wireless communication with the command center

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained valuable knowledge and skills in the following areas:

- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Image Processing
- Remote Sensing
- Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
- Build-a-Bot
- Shortest Path Algorithms
- Wireless Communication
